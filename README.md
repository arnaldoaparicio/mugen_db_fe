# README

This is the untitled MUGEN DB frontend. Created with Ruby on Rails.
This is a WIP and is currently in its very early development.

## What is MUGEN?
MUGEN is a 2d fighting game engine created by a company named Elecbyte. The purpose is for the user to create their own 2d fighting game. It is highly customizable, thus allowing the user to make changes to anything they desire. The sky is the limit.

## Why does this exist?
The purpose of this is to provide a large collection of links for the user to easily access assets for use with MUGEN. This includes characters, stages, screenpacks, lifebars, and other miscellaneous resources. Many of the databases that exist, past or present, are either defunct or severely out of date. The goal is to provide an up-to-date repository for everything involving MUGEN.
